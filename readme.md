## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css

### Time required

It took me nearly 4 hours to complete the entire static project.

### What I learned

This is the css design code snippet of the container section, through which i got more clear on positioning of an image in a backgorund.

```css
.container {
  height: 100vh;
  background-image: url("assets/bg.png ");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100% 100%;
  background-position: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I have learned a lot on positioning of images and theres a lot more to experience with it.
